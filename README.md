AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers. However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post 5G launch in May 2022. Atliqo’s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights that would enable them to make informed decisions.

👉 As we have increased plan revenue while declining trend of active users and growth of unsubscribed customers since the introduction of 5G. Plan 8, 9, and 10 have been discontinued and Plan 11, 12 and 13 have been introduced after 5G. We have observed that Plan 4, 5, 6, and 7 have experienced a declined revenue growth. So, we need to focus more on these plans along with the newly introduced plans to attract more active users. 



👉 To achieve the forecasted plan revenue, we need to balance the trade between average revenue per user and unsubscribed users. It's recommended to make attention to Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata city. Apart from that, we could introduce modified attractive plans and roll out offers to increase the engagement for Patna, Coimbatore, Chandigarh, Gurgaon, and Raipur as these are the bottom 5 cities in terms of revenue generation.



👉 Though we have experienced a steady growth of market value in the cities across the months, the percentage of market share gained by the respective company from the total market value declined in recent months. We can adopt the resilient strategy and rethink policy design following the first 4months of Before 5G phase.
